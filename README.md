This journal was created as a place for me to record all of my small projects in data science and related fields. During my study journey, there are many concepts, skills, and tools that I cannot fully understand them throught textbook, especially the math and mechanism underneath. Doing small projects and recreate every thing from scratch is the best way for me, and may be for any person, to grasp the whole idea from the bottom up.<br>

I will update this journal frequently. Stay Tuned!<br>

# Algorithmic Trading with Deep Learning.
- [Crytopcurrency Price Prediction in Small Time Intervals.](https://github.com/ba-luan/data_science_journal/tree/main/Crytopcurrency%20Price%20Prediction%20in%20Small%20Time%20Intervals): An extensive experiment tested the performance of a deep learning model (LSTMs were the main layers) in predicting trading signals. The data was transformed for a Classification problem, not the Regression problem. Binance API used to retrieve historical data due to its scale and representation. Database deployed with SQLite. Hyperparameters tuning combined with 2 different labelings methods in training and testing process. 

# Natural Language Processing.
- [Amazon Reviews Sentiment Analysis.](https://github.com/ba-luan/data_science_journal/blob/main/Amazon%20Reviews%20Sentiment%20Analysis/main_code.ipynb): An implementation of Bag-of-words method; Naive Bayes Classifier used to classify positive and negative reviews.

# Time-series Analysis.
- [Human Activity Recognization (HAR).](https://github.com/ba-luan/data_science_journal/tree/main/Human%20Activity%20Recognization%20(HAR)): Clustering human activities by using sensor data from smartphones.
